# Postica ⚡️

> A modern, minimal blog platform to write, manage, and publish posts with ease.

## 📄 What is Postica?

Postica is a simple yet powerful personal blog application built to help you publish your thoughts, articles, or notes.  
It aims to deliver a clean, responsive UI and a solid foundation you can extend — whether you want a static-site blog, a full dynamic blog with CMS-like features, or something in between.

## 🎯 Why Postica?

- Built with modern frontend tooling (React + Vite) to give fast builds and smooth user experience  
- Easy to understand, customize, and extend — ideal for learning, hacking, or building a personal site  
- Provides core blogging features you expect (creating, editing, deleting, publishing posts) out of the box

## ✅ Features

> - Post categories / tags  
> - Comments / reactions  
> - User authentication (multiple authors)  
> - Static export (static site generation) or backend + database for persistence

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React + Vite + JavaScript (or TypeScript if you choose)  
- **Styling:** (e.g. CSS, Tailwind, or your choice)  
- **Build Tools:** Vite  
- *(Optional / future)* **Backend:** Node.js + Express, or any backend of your choice — to support persistent storage, authentication, etc.  

*(If you don’t yet have a backend, this remains a frontend-only blog / static-site platform.)*
